Now place the chickpeas, aquafaba (juice from chickpeas), salt, garlic cloves, cumin, lemon juice, and tahini in a food processor and blend until smooth. Set this aside for now. Next, place the barley in a pot of boiling water and boil for 10 minutes, until cooked but still with a slight chew. Drain and set this aside. Now it is time to temper the spices, heat your oil in a saucepan over medium heat, and fry the cumin and coriander seeds for 10-20 seconds until they start to pop. Pour this out onto a plate to cool so it doesn’t cook further in the pan. Assemble your bowls, divide the hummus between two plates and spread it out with a spoon. Lay the butternut squash sizes over and pour the barley on top. Take the tempered spices and oil and pour this over the barley. Finally garnish with pomegranate seeds. Enjoy!",
